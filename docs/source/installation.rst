Installation
============

Installation is easy using ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

       $ pip install pyhoe

Or you can grab it from Github.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install git+https://modocache@github.com/modocache/pyhoe.git

You can also download the source from Github.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ git clone git@github.com:modocache/pyhoe.git
        $ cd pyhoe
        $ python setup.py install


Requirements
************

pyhoe is compatible and tested on Python 2.7 and Python 3.2.
Other versions are untested.

pyhoe has no requirements for plain usage, although several
packages are installed to new virtual environments when starting
a new project using the ``sow`` command.
